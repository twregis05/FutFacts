# Top 2 Apps

My top two apps from this list are:
### 1. Soccer Player Analyzer
    - Mobile: 
        - Real-time data, portable stats
        - Don't need to use a web browser and try to view data (can be tedious on mobile)
    - Story: 
        - Many people use similar apps (i.e. OneFootball), many of which don't directly compare players/teams 
        - Many of my peers would think this would be an interesting app to have!
    - Market: 
        - Soccer fans (global fanbase; HUGE!)
    - Habit: 
        - Moreso addicting than habit forming, but most wouldn't become addicted to an app like this
        - Average user would likely open the app twice a week for less than 30 minutes each day
        - Could fluctuate depending on transfer news/deadline day
    - Scope: 
        - Somewhat difficult to do
        - Need to pull stats from API
        - Need to incorporate user login
        - Potential incorporation of data visualization
        - This can be mostly done if significant work is done within the next week

### 2. Productivity App
    - Mobile: 
        - Users are far more likely to use a mobile app for 
          productivity than a website
    - Story: 
        - Many users would benefit from an AI powered productivity app 
        - They use reminders/ToDo lists but may struggle to 
          organize a plan of action
    - Market: 
        - Anybody who is driven and wants to accomplish something can use this app!
    - Habit:
        - Extremely habit-forming
        - Users would create (in a sense) instead of consuming
    - Scope:
        - Might not be too challenging
        - ChatGPT integration may cost money
        - Stripped down version would not be very interesting; just another todo app

### Final Decision:
I will be building the Soccer Player Analyzer since it may be more unique and provides the user with real-time data. It is a project that will challenge me and is geneuinely interesting to me.
